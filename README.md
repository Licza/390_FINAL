# STOR 390 Final Paper
## Title: PrOCTOR: A Data-Driven Model for Predicting Drug Toxicity and Its Ethical Implications in Clinical Trials

This project critically examines the methodologies and findings presented in the paper "A Data-Driven Approach to Predicting Successes and Failures of Clinical Trials," which introduces a model for predicting drug toxicity in clinical trials. I evaluate different statistical considerations  to critique the methods used and explore the ethical implications of implementing such a model, appealing to the philosophical framework of Deontology to ultimately argue against its use.
